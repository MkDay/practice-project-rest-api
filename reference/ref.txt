* this project we practice to work with CRUD operations.
* we don't use database here. just an array to work with.
* we use a package uuid to assign an unique id into each user.
* since we don't use a database we had to work with array methods like 
    - array.push() : add a new user into the user array
    - array.find() : find a specific user from the user array
    - array.filter() : filter out a specific user after deleting that user
    - spread operator : add an unique id using 'uuidv4()' method into each user.
        users.push({ ...user, id: uuidv4()});

* difference between PATCH & PUT:
    - PATCH : update some specific data only
    - PUT : override existing data with new data

* why we use Postman?
    - because browser can perform GET request only.
    - postman can perform every kind of requests.
